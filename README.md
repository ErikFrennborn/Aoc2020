# Description
My soltuions for Advent of Code 2020.  I decided to use this opportunity to improve my c++ and challenge myself to find parallelism and other optimizations to improve performance.

Note:
Due to the relativity small problem size, the parallelized version of the solution aren't always the best because of the added setup time and overhead (too fine gain and so on).
